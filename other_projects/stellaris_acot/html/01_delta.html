    <h1>Delta</h1>
    <div class="info">
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        To unlock Delta you first need to research the ability to harvest Dark
        Matter and Dark Energy through their respective drawing technologies.
        This unlocks three new technologies Dark Matter Generation, Dark Matter
        Containment, and Dark Matter Applications. To research these you need a
        scientist that is at least level 6 with any of the following traits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Curator</li>
        <li>Spark of Genius</li>
        <li>Psionics</li>
        <li>Chosen One</li>
        <li>Brainslug</li>
        <li>Sapient AI Assistant</li>
        <li>Erudite</li>
        <li>Paricles/Materials/Military Expertise</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <h2>Strategy for obtaining</h2>
      <p>
        Obtaining Delta is heavily focused on having good research. Therefore, I
        would recommend focusing on building up your technology production from
        the start of the game. Since leader levels and and traits matter, I
        would also focus on getting leader life span and experience gain up. Out
        of all the traits, the expertise are the easiest to obtain since any
        scientist can spawn with those and you will eventually get them if you
        continue buying new ones.
