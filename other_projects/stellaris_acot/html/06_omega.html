      <p>
        Omega is by far the hardest tier of technology to unlock. It consists of
        opening an outer gate and then fighting the Stellarborne which are using
        Omega. You will get the ability to unlock the outer gates as soon as the
        mid-game starts.

      <h2>Strategy for obtaining</h2>
      <p>
        The only thing that matters for Omega is your Fleet. The Stellarborne is
        incredibly powerful and will wipe out basically anything. The only
        technology that can even compare to Omega is Theta. Use those weapons on
        the best ship ACOT has to offer, the Herculean. If you ever think you
        are ready to face the Stellarborne, you are probably not. You can take
        all time you need. When you have Theta, nothing except the Stellarborne
        can challenge your power. Only open the outer gates when you have a
        ridiculous amount of Herculeans.
