      <p>
        Unlocking Phi is one of the harder challenges in the mod. You will face
        an enemy with far superior technology, namely Phi itself. To face said
        enemy you need to build a Dimensional Portal. The event that allows you
        to research the portal will have a mean time to happen of 20 years after
        a few conditions are met. The countdown will start when you have
        researched the most advanced Stellarite reactor and done the
        reimagination project for the precursor starbase. All reimagination
        projects can be found in the precursor database. After building the
        dimensional portal, activate it. You will need to defeat the fleet that
        spawns, and then the invade the vault. This process will repeat a few
        times before you unlock Phi.

      <h2>Strategy for obtaining</h2>
      <p>
        Unlocking Phi can be broken down into two aspects. Starting the
        countdown and fighting. Doing the reimagination project is extremely
        expensive, both in terms of resources but also research. As soon as you
        have unlocked Alpha, you should start focusing on building up your
        economy and research while unlocking Sigma. As soon as the requirements
        are met and the 20 year countdown has started you should switch your
        focus to your military. You will fight both in space and on the ground
        so do not forget your ground forces. You will need a large fleet with
        top of the line Sigma weapons with a good general to even stand a
        chance. If you barely win one of the fights, take a break and build up
        more since the next one will be harder.
